QuickAccess README

About:
======
I loved the Kickerapplet to browse through directories and 
since there is no replacement for KDE4/Plasma yet I thought 
I try to do something similar...
Well thats the result...

My work is based on the work of some other people, and they should be mentioned:
Robert Knight: pieces of code from Kickoff
Peter Penz   : IconManager

Install:
========
You need at least KDE 4.1 beta, because the Plasma-API changed 
from 4.0 to 4.1 and I don't know if it works as expected (or at all) on KDE 4.0.x

You will need the following packages and the corresponding devel packages:
-kdelibs
-kdebase-workspace
-libkonq

to install:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..
make
sudo make install

You have to restart plasma to find QuickAccess in the Add Applets dialog:
kquitapp plasma && plasma
